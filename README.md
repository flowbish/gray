# ＧＲＡＹ
## :rainbow: the prideful ray tracer :horse:

ＧＲＡＹ is the product of our time at MTU's Winter Wonderhack hackathon. It is a 2D raytracing engine, capable of simulating refraction through glass-like representations objects from images.

ＧＲＡＹ was developed in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) graphics library.
